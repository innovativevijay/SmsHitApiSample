# SmsHitApiSample
Code samples in C#, Java, Node.js, PHP, and Python demonstrate how to perform HTTP GET requests for sending SMS via an API. 


# SMS API Integration

This repository provides code samples in C#, Java, Node.js, PHP, and Python for interacting with an SMS API through HTTP GET requests.

## C#

[C# Code](csharp/SmsApiClient.cs) demonstrates an object-oriented approach using the `SmsApiClient` class. Replace placeholders in the `Main` method with credentials.

## Java

[Java Code](java/SmsApiClient.java) showcases the `SmsApiClient` class, constructing the URL in the `sendSingleSms` method. Update credentials in the `main` method.

## Node.js

[Node.js Code](nodejs/smsApiClient.js) uses the `SmsApiClient` class for SMS API interaction. Update credentials in the main program and ensure Node.js is installed.

## PHP

[PHP Code](php/SmsApiClient.php) is organized with the `SmsApiClient` class. Replace placeholders within the `main` section to interact with the SMS API.

## Python

[Python Code](python/SmsApiClient.py) is object-oriented. Replace placeholders in the main program to interact with the SMS API. Ensure Python is installed.

Feel free to explore and use these code samples in your projects!
